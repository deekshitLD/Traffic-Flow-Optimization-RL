# Traffic Flow Optimization using Reinforcement Learning
This is an example code for a reinforcement learning-based system that aims to optimize traffic flow in a city. The code demonstrates the training process of a Deep Q-Network (DQN) agent in a custom traffic optimization environment.

# Environment
The TrafficEnvironment class represents the traffic optimization environment. It defines the state space, action space, and other parameters related to the environment. The step() method executes an action, updates the state, and provides the reward, done flag, and additional information. The reset() method resets the environment to the initial state.

# DQN Agent
The DQNAgent class represents the Deep Q-Network (DQN) agent. It initializes the agent with the state space and action space dimensions. The choose_action() method selects an action based on the current state using an epsilon-greedy strategy. The update_q_values() method updates the Q-values of the agent based on the observed state, action, reward, next state, and done flag.

# Training
Create an instance of the TrafficEnvironment class to set up the traffic optimization environment.

Create an instance of the DQNAgent class, providing the state space and action space dimensions.

Train the agent in the traffic environment using a loop over episodes.

Reset the environment to the initial state using the reset() method.
Execute actions, observe rewards and next states, and update Q-values using the choose_action() and update_q_values() methods.
Repeat until the episode is completed.
